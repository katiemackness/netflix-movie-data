Netflix, which began as a DVD rental service in 1997, has grown into one of the largest entertainment and media companies globally. With a vast array of content available on the platform, it presents a unique opportunity to delve into the entertainment industry and extract meaningful patterns and trends. In this analysis, we explore a dataset of Netflix movies and series to uncover strategic insights about genre popularity, geographic distribution, and audience preferences.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing values in `director`, `cast`, and `country` columns  
- Converted `date_added` to datetime objects  
- Filtered out titles with incomplete metadata for consistent analysis  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Content volume by decade and type  
- Genre distribution trends over time  
- Country-wise production volume  
- Runtime and season-length analysis by decade  

Visualizations include bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to highlight key patterns and anomalies.

---

## Conclusion

Key findings:
- **Genre Shifts**: Certain genres (e.g., drama, documentary) have grown steadily, while others peaked in specific eras.  
- **Geographic Expansion**: Content production has diversified globally beyond a few dominant countries.  
- **Runtime Trends**: Average runtimes decreased over time, reflecting changes in audience consumption habits.

These insights can guide content acquisition strategies, genre investment decisions, and international market targeting.

## Future Work

- Deeper analysis of TV series trends (season counts, episode lengths)  
- Incorporate viewer ratings and sentiment data where available  
- Correlate release timing with external events (e.g., awards, platform expansions)  
- Compare with competitor platforms for cross-service insights
